/* üèÅ Your Goal: Charity Donation
 * - Let's take all funds that were passed to the receive function and donate them to charity. We'll do this in two steps.
 * - First, modify the constructor to accept a new argument: the charity address.
 * - Next, add a new function called donate. When this function is called transfer all remaining funds in the contract to the charity address.
