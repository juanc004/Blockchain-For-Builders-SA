# Blockchain for Builders: Smart Contract Programming

# About

Welcome to the Blockchain for Builders: Smart Contract Programming repository! This repository is a part of our coding meetup series aimed at helping developers master the art of building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the blockchain using Solidity, Foundry, and Hardhat. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to blockchain technology, this series will provide you with the tools and knowledge needed to succeed.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed:

1. Install[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Install A popular code editor that makes it easier to work with Solidity and other programming languages.
   - Install via homebrew:
   

```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

1. **Node.js** - A JavaScript runtime essential for running development scripts and working with blockchain tools.
    - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
    - Install via terminal:
    
    ```
    brew install node
    ```
    
2. **Git** - A version control system for tracking changes in your code and collaborating with others. Also, create a GitHub account if you don't have one yet.
    - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - Install via terminal:
    
    ```
    brew install git
    ```
    
3. **MetaMask** - A popular Ethereum wallet that allows you to interact with the blockchain from your browser.
    - [Download MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/)
4. **Foundry** - A blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
    - [Foundry Installation Guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
    - Install via terminal:
    
    ```
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    ```
    

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the repository:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine using Git:
